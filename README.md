this is the repo for the files of assignment 1 in the verification module


After finishing the FIFO test, interface and top files, the whole project has been compiled with no compilation error.
however, when testing the fifo module it appears that the are errors in the functionality that does not match the funtionality description
after doing some tests, it appears that the module is not taking the complete 8bits width of the data entered, and is missing the most significant bit

please fix your module and report back, thank you.
